## Extension ownership

The controlled extension model introduced in v0.4 remains active unchanged
through DeepSeek Harness's official extension mechanisms. The Action does not
define a second plugin system:

- `@deepseek-ai/dsh-mcp-client@0.2.1-rc.2` owns MCP connection, discovery,
  registration, reconnect, and dispatch.
- DSH Profile and Bundle manifests own Bundle composition. Cordis owns plugin
  loading and configuration.
- The Action Controller validates trusted workflow inputs, computes the
  effective grants, generates the `github-action` Profile and Cordis patch, and
  installs one positive ToolRuntime policy adapter.
- The DSH runner reaches that construction through the internal
  `DshComposition` boundary. The default `ControlledComposition` declares the
  Controller as its tool-policy owner. Controller orchestration records the
  matching exact requested/effective/denied audit.
- Experimental `NativeComposition` uses the locked official DSH
  `0.2.1-rc.2` headless composition without constructing the controlled
  `github-action` grant Profile or its ToolRuntime policy adapter. Its native
  Profile composes configured Bundles as official layers, official MCP client
  rows, and direct Cordis Plugins. DSH owns discovery, registration, the
  internal capability graph, and final inventory; the Action reports its
  runtime-observed tool names as telemetry.
- The native schema is definition-only and owner/process-shaped. It contains no
  declared tools, Action manifests, grants, per-tool budgets, or controlled
  receipts. Repository `.dsh/skills` / `.agents/skills` plus rc.2 Subagent and
  Workflow capabilities remain native DSH graph inputs rather than Action
  providers.
- The v0.3 placeholder `ExtensionProvider` seam has been removed. MCP and
  plugin tools are not routed through a parallel Action plugin registry.

Controlled Profile rows, runtime tool names, and tool budgets belong to the
DSH controlled composition. The shared extension module resolves installed
plugin entry points for both compositions; it does not select runtime policy.
The Action boots its controlled Profile through the official
`@deepseek-ai/dsh-app-boot@0.2.1-rc.2` public API.

Each outer-loop iteration starts a DSH headless process over the run-scoped
`.git`-less workspace. Controlled mode also reuses invocation counts and
receipts across turns. Optional [Controller Sessions](session.md) restore
portable DSH text context after checking current authority; prior tool effects
are never replayed. Session preparation and checkpoint storage belong to the
Controller lifecycle, outside the `AgentEngine` turn contract.

## Versioned configuration

`mcp-config`, `plugin-config`, and `tool-config` currently require
`schemaVersion: 1`. Agent turns and structured DSH output independently use
protocol version 1. Unknown fields and unsupported schema versions fail closed.
`task-output-schema` is not another protocol or authorization envelope: it is a
bounded trusted schema used to validate one optional `taskOutput` field inside
the existing Controller result.

`dsh-mode` is independent of those schema versions. `controlled` is the
compatible default; `native` selects the official headless composition and is
currently Docker-only. Controlled and native parse different schema-v1
extension shapes: controlled declares exact canonical tools and budgets, while
native declares only owners, official loading definitions, and process-level
network/workspace requirements. A controlled-shaped native configuration fails
closed instead of being reinterpreted.

The Controller accepts only `@deepseek-ai/dsh@0.2.1-rc.2` and the matching
official package family. Every directly used DSH package is an exact top-level
pin, shipped packages are installed from the committed lockfile, and the
runtime verifies that every installed `@deepseek-ai/dsh*` entry has the audited
rc.2 version. A new DSH version requires a reviewed Profile, native tool
inventory, compatibility tests, and a new accepted pin.

The [0.1.7-rc.2-to-0.2.1-rc.2 audit](dsh-0.2.1-rc.2-migration.md) covers
app-boot, Profile/Bundle/Plugin composition, MCP, ToolRuntime, Bash, Web Search,
Subagent, Workflow/PTC, Session lifecycle, receipts, and Docker/path/timeout
behavior. The Action retains its existing inputs, outputs, and permission
semantics while adapting the affected runtime contracts. Qualification applies
only to the exact `0.2.1-rc.2` family; later release candidates, alpha versions,
and the upstream development branch require independent review.

## Run-scoped lifecycle and bounded phases

The runtime controller is separated into process launch, exact package
installation and inventory audit, network selection, Docker policy, Profile
assembly, and receipt reconciliation responsibilities. Their temporary
directories, DSH home, npm cache, sessions, counters, and tool state are bound
to one Action run. Runtime reuse requires the complete audited identity to
match; setup or extension-install failure rolls back partially created state.

Runtime creation and installation, extension installation, each Agent turn,
Controller validation, cleanup, and cancellation finalization each have an
independent cap. A phase always receives the smaller of that cap and the
remaining overall Action deadline, so setup cannot consume the entire task
budget and no local phase budget can extend the total deadline. `SIGTERM` and
`SIGINT` trigger a bounded best-effort abort, worker cleanup, and eligible
sticky-comment finalization. `SIGKILL`, host/runner loss, a process crash, or a
network/GitHub API outage can prevent finalization entirely.

`container-image`, `base-url`, `isolation`, and `dsh-executable` are trusted
capability inputs. They select executable worker code, the destination that
receives controller-proxied DeepSeek requests, or whether a process boundary
exists, so they must never be derived from repository/event/model content.
Every supplied image value is validated as one Docker/OCI reference and cannot
begin with an option or contain argument-breaking whitespace. Extensions and
writes additionally require an immutable full image digest.

Third-party Bundle and plugin sources use a different lock boundary. Each
top-level package must be an exact semver or a GitHub `git+https` URL pinned to
a 40-character commit. `latest`, semver ranges, floating Git refs, and attempts
to replace Controller-owned DSH packages are invalid. NPM lifecycle scripts are
disabled during installation, but the resolved transitive graph is still a
trusted supply-chain decision and package startup remains trusted code
execution. Before installation the Controller snapshots every top-level runtime
package identity and version. It reads that inventory again afterwards and
rejects an installation that removed or changed any pre-existing runtime
package before starting DSH.

## Controller authority and DSH composition

The Action has two deliberately separate execution planes:

1. The Controller `ToolRouter` invokes maintainer-defined `command.*` tools and
   the closed `github.*` catalog. Commands accept no model arguments and run
   fixed argv in credential-free containers. GitHub tools accept only typed,
   bounded data while repository/entity/head identity comes from Controller
   context; mutations are queued until validated finalization.
2. DSH invokes model-routed tools inside the worker. In controlled mode an
   Action-owned Cordis policy adapter applies the Controller-generated positive
   runtime allowlist and budgets to native workspace, official MCP, and Cordis
   plugin calls. In native mode the locked official headless composition owns
   its internal capability graph; no controlled ToolRuntime allowlist is
   presented as complete native authority.

Controlled mode supplies both planes from the same Controller-resolved security
capabilities and exposes canonical `AgentToolManifest` records to the model.
Routing or registration is not authorization. A configured controlled tool
becomes effective only when its canonical ID is also in `allowed-tools` and
every requested permission is allowed by the current actor/origin/event policy.
This limits the model-facing dispatcher; it does not sandbox already-approved
stdio, Bundle, or plugin code that performs startup, background, or direct
process I/O.

Native mode changes only DSH composition ownership. `command.*` and `github.*`
remain in the Controller `ToolRouter`; repository/entity binding, GitHub token
use, validation, deferred mutation, and postconditions do not move into DSH.
Likewise, the worker still receives a read-only or read-write disposable mount
selected by Action trust policy, only an ephemeral DeepSeek proxy credential,
and no real GitHub token. Docker, network construction, deadlines,
cancellation, cleanup, and redaction remain Action-owned boundaries.

The public tool-policy audit keeps authorization separate from observation.
For `ControlledComposition`, `policyOwner: controller` means `effectiveTools`
is exactly the final canonical manifest set. For `NativeComposition`,
`policyOwner: dsh` reports the actual root-Agent inventory observed from DSH's
public `ToolRuntime.schemas(agent)` runtime surface. Those names are
`observedTools` telemetry and cannot be represented as Controller-effective
grants; native `toolPolicy` therefore has no `effectiveTools` field. The Action
also records `dsh-mode` / `dsh-composition`, and `.dsh.mode` /
`.dsh.composition` in `result-json`; the stable composition identities are
`github-action-controlled` and `dsh-native-headless`.

Canonical Action IDs for the controlled and Controller-owned planes are:

- `workspace.read`, `workspace.search`, and `workspace.edit` for audited DSH
  native tools;
- `command.<name>` for fixed-argv Controller tools;
- the six exact `github.issue.*`, `github.comment.create`,
  `github.pull.metadata.update`, and `github.checks.read` IDs documented in
  [Configuration](configuration.md#controller-owned-github-tools);
- `mcp.<server-id>.<tool-id>` for MCP tools; and
- `plugin.<extension-id>.<tool-id>` for Bundle or direct plugin tools.

In controlled mode, the Action derives MCP's model-facing
`mcp__<server>__<raw-tool>` name with the
official normalization and hash contract. Package tools must declare a unique
runtime name beginning with `plugin__<extension-id>__`. A model-facing runtime
name never replaces the canonical Action ID as an authorization key.

## Native official-ecosystem composition

This section applies only to `dsh-mode: native`. Native prepares a run-scoped
official Profile over the exact `0.2.1-rc.2` package family. Its manifest keeps
the locked `@deepseek-ai/dsh-base` and `@deepseek-ai/dsh-headless` layers and
appends each admitted Bundle package to `dsh.profile.bundles`. Its Cordis patch
inserts each MCP owner as an official `@deepseek-ai/dsh-mcp-client` row and each
direct Plugin as the verified installed module plus its JSON `config`. There is
no Action plugin/provider registry in this path.

The native schema is definition-only:

- A stdio MCP owner declares `id`, `transport`, `command`, optional `args`,
  ordinary `env`, explicit `credentialEnv`, and repository-relative `cwd`,
  owner-level `network` and `workspaceWrite`, server-level `toolCallTimeoutMs`,
  and reconnect settings.
- A Streamable HTTP MCP owner declares the same common fields plus HTTP(S)
  `url`, ordinary `headers`, and explicit `credentialHeaders`; its `network` is
  necessarily `true`.
- A Bundle declares `id`, `package`, exact `source`, `network`, and
  `workspaceWrite`.
- A direct Plugin declares the Bundle fields plus a JSON `config` object and an
  explicit string-valued `credentialConfig` map.

None of those definitions contains a `tools` list, canonical `mcp.*` or
`plugin.*` grants, permission arrays, `maxCalls`, `maxOutputBytes`, per-tool
timeouts, Action manifests, or controlled receipts. The MCP
`toolCallTimeoutMs` is the official client's server-wide execution limit, not a
Controller prediction or grant. Native `mcp.*` / `plugin.*` values in
`allowed-tools` or `disallowed-tools` are rejected because DSH owns that
inventory.

At boot, official DSH/Cordis code performs discovery, registration, and
dispatch. Configured Bundle and Plugin capabilities therefore join the same
native graph as the base/headless ecosystem. The official Skill system also
discovers project Skills under `.dsh/skills` and `.agents/skills` directly from
the disposable `.git`-less Action workspace. The locked Subagent and Workflow
services remain graph-native and can register their normal capabilities. None
of Skills, Subagents, or Workflows is repackaged as an Action extension or
placed behind the controlled ToolRuntime adapter.

The Action observes the root Agent's actual model-facing schema after that
graph exists. Dynamic MCP, Bundle, and Plugin names are therefore reported only
in `toolPolicy.observedTools`, alongside native Skill/Subagent/Workflow names
when visible. Observation is inventory telemetry, not invocation evidence or a
Controller grant; native has no `effectiveTools`, requested/denied inventory,
or synthetic receipt policy for those DSH tools.

Outer admission remains Action-owned. Any non-empty native extension plan
requires eligible trusted same-repository authority, repository access, and
extension loading authority. An owner requesting network additionally requires
Action network authority; an owner requesting `workspaceWrite` requires
trusted-write and modify-workspace authority. These declarations cannot elevate
the run. They are process requirements: one `network: true` owner selects
Docker bridge egress for the entire native worker, and a read/write repository
mount is likewise shared by every capability in that worker. Neither is a
per-owner or per-tool sandbox.

Bundle and Plugin packages still require an exact npm semver or a GitHub source
pinned to a lowercase 40-character commit, plus the separate
`allow-plugin-install=true` gate.
Installation uses `--ignore-scripts`, rejects shadowing the locked runtime,
verifies installed identity/pin and lock provenance, and rejects any removal or
version change in the pre-existing top-level runtime package inventory. Those
checks do not sandbox Bundle patches or Plugin startup; admitted packages and
stdio MCP executables remain trusted worker code.

An MCP or direct Plugin may receive its own credential-like workflow values.
Native definitions put arbitrary-name secrets in `credentialEnv`,
`credentialHeaders`, or `credentialConfig`. The Action merges those values into
the official extension config, masks them without relying on name heuristics,
and represents them in `result-json.authority`
only as one generic owner record, without values, hashes, counts, headers,
argv/env fields, or URL path/query material. The real DeepSeek key, Action
GitHub token, their reserved names, and GitHub Actions OIDC variables remain
forbidden in configuration and absent from the worker. A user-configured GitHub
MCP with its own credential is therefore trusted external extension authority:
its direct calls do not inherit the Controller `github.*` Gateway's binding,
revalidation, Controller validation, deferred mutation, postconditions, or
receipts. This Action does not implement a GitHub MCP backend.

## Controlled Profile, Bundle, and Cordis loading

This section applies only to `dsh-mode: controlled`. For Docker execution, the Controller generates
`$DSH_HOME/profiles/github-action/package.json`, `cordis.patch.yml`, and
`pnpm-workspace.yaml`. The Profile always composes the reviewed
`@deepseek-ai/dsh-base` and `@deepseek-ai/dsh-headless` Bundles, then adds only
effective third-party Bundles to `dsh.profile.bundles`.

The generated Cordis patch:

- disables unapproved shell, web, skill, subagent, workflow, and PTC runtime
  rows from the base Bundle;
- configures the DSH sandbox and filesystem root for the bound workspace;
- inserts only effective official MCP and direct plugin rows;
- inserts the Action-owned workspace and ToolRuntime policy adapters; and
- serializes workflow values as JSON data, preventing a string from becoming a
  new YAML patch row or `!!js` expression.

The Action passes that generated Profile and Cordis patch directly to the
official app-boot API. It does not load workspace or `$DSH_HOME` `.env` files,
and it does not enable the CLI's dynamic user-patch discovery, watch, or hot
reload path. Repository content and files left in DSH home therefore cannot add
an extension row or environment value after Controller validation.

`allow-plugin-install` defaults to `false`. When it is true and at least one
package tool is effective, installation uses the exact top-level source with
NPM lifecycle scripts disabled. After installation the Controller verifies the
package identity and version or Git commit. For a Bundle it also resolves
`dsh.bundle.patch` and rejects a patch path whose real path escapes the
installed package.

These checks and ToolRuntime do not sandbox approved package code. A Bundle
patch and direct plugin execute full trusted worker code in the DSH process
during startup, before any model tool call. The package may continue background
work or perform direct process I/O outside the ToolRuntime call hook. The same
boundary applies to launching an approved stdio MCP executable. Treat enabling it as
trusted worker-code execution and review its source, transitive dependencies,
configuration, filesystem access, and network requirements.

## Official MCP contract

`mcp-config` exposes only transports supported by the official rc.2 client:

- `stdio`, with a bare executable name or absolute container path; or
- `streamable-http`, with an HTTP(S) URL and explicit headers.

Stdio commands cannot be shells, interpreters, downloaders, package managers,
Git, dynamic runners, relative paths, or executables under `/workspace`.
Optional `cwd` is repository-relative and cannot escape the workspace. Env
names that alter executable lookup, loaders, or interpreter startup are
rejected. Starting the configured executable is full trusted worker-code
execution. Credential-like argv fields and env entries are masked as worker
credentials; ordinary argv and env values are not automatically treated as
secrets. HTTP URLs cannot embed credentials or fragments and cannot override
transport-owned headers. Structured audit output exposes only the URL origin,
not pathname, query, or headers; the public profile digest covers this redacted
audit surface, while a separate Controller-only digest binds the complete
validated server definition.

The real DeepSeek key and configured GitHub token values are rejected from
extension configuration. Names such as `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`,
`GH_TOKEN`, and GitHub Actions OIDC variables are also reserved. An extension
may receive its own explicit env/header secret; it is masked and treated as a
worker credential, not Controller authority.

The top-level `result-json.authority.knownSources` audit mirrors that boundary
without publishing configuration data. The GitHub and DeepSeek records are
Controller-owned credentials whose real bytes are not exposed to the worker;
DeepSeek access is mediated by the run-scoped proxy. A generic
`extension-credential` record is emitted once for an effective MCP server or
direct Plugin in controlled mode when the compatible credential-like detector
finds a value, or for an admitted native MCP/direct Plugin when either that
detector or an explicit native credential channel supplies a value. It carries only the extension kind and
ID: no secret type, value, hash, count, header, argv/env field, or URL
path/query is included. Controlled configured-but-non-effective extensions are
omitted; native has no predicted effective-tool set, so admission is the
reported plan fact.

This is an Action-known-source audit, not a claim of complete worker authority.
Trusted extension startup/background code may still use its network grant,
runner ambient state, or other process capabilities outside model-routed calls.
Neither this audit nor extension receipts prove the absence of those paths.

The Controller-secret rejection scan walks all nested object keys and string
values in both manifests and checks percent-decoded variants, including encoded
URL path and query material. It runs again immediately before Profile rendering
against ambient GitHub, OIDC, and DeepSeek Controller values, so renaming one of
those values under an extension key does not expose it. Controlled secret
masking retains its narrower compatible heuristic. Native additionally masks
every explicit `credentialEnv`, `credentialHeaders`, and `credentialConfig`
value regardless of its key name. Ordinary plugin values such as `read` and
`safe-json` are not registered as secrets or masked.

The following registration and restriction contract applies only to controlled
mode. Every selected controlled server starts with
`failOnStartupError: true`. Only a tool that
is selected by `allowed-tools` and survives Controller policy to become
effective is required to appear in the runtime inventory; its absence fails
closed. Before restriction, the model-visible inventory must satisfy
`visible ⊆ known` and `allowed ⊆ visible`: every visible tool is in the
Controller-audited inventory, and every allowed tool registered successfully. A
configured but unselected known tool may be absent. After restriction,
`visible == allowed`; any unknown tool, missing allowed tool, or unselected known
tool that remains visible fails closed, including an agent-scoped registration
that the global restriction could not hide. The monotonic ToolRuntime guard also
denies every invocation without an effective Controller rule. MCP results remain
untrusted data even when the server and workflow configuration are trusted.

Native also sets `failOnStartupError: true`, but then leaves discovery,
registration, model visibility, and dispatch to the official client and DSH
graph. It does not run the controlled known/allowed/visible equality checks,
because its workflow definition contains no predicted tool list. The actual
root inventory is recorded as `observedTools` only.

For a controlled server, the official client exposes a server-wide
`toolCallTimeoutMs`. The Action sets
it to the largest timeout among that server's effective, allowed tools so a
slower approved tool is not cut off by a faster sibling. The Action-owned
ToolRuntime policy then applies each tool's own timeout as an additional,
potentially tighter upper bound.

For a native server, `toolCallTimeoutMs` is provided directly by the
definition-only owner schema and remains one official-client server-wide
timeout. There is no Action per-tool timeout or call/output budget layered on
the DSH-native inventory.

## Process-level permission compatibility

In controlled mode, `read`, `workspace-write`, and `network` are declared on
every extension tool, but filesystem mounts and network namespaces belong to
the whole DSH process. Every controlled extension tool must include `read`,
because all co-hosted extension code shares the Agent's repository view. The
Controller therefore rejects unsafe controlled co-tenancy rather than
pretending to provide per-tool process isolation:

- all configured tools from one MCP server or package must agree on
  `workspace-write`;
- all effective MCP servers, Bundles, and plugins in one worker must agree on
  both network and workspace-write mode;
- a trusted-read worker accepts only read-only owners;
- every owner in a trusted-write worker must declare `workspace-write`; and
- any effective MCP, Bundle, or plugin requires Docker isolation. The host-only
  `dsh-executable` compatibility path never loads extensions.

Native does not copy that tool-shaped co-tenancy calculation. Its owner-level
flags are outer admission and audit facts, not DSH tool permissions. Any native
owner with `network: true` selects bridge egress for the entire worker; if no
owner requests it, the worker uses the internal-network path. Any owner with
`workspaceWrite: true` requires trusted-write authority, but the actual
read-only/read-write repository mount is selected for the complete native
worker by Action trust/write policy. A `false` value cannot sandbox one owner
from a mount or network path available to another capability. Native itself
always requires Docker, including trusted-read work.

`network=false` does not mean that the worker has no network path. When no owner
requests network, the worker uses an internal Docker network that blocks
ordinary external egress. The Controller inspects that network's IPv4 gateway
and maps `host.docker.internal` to the inspected address for the Controller LLM
proxy; an invalid or missing inspected gateway fails closed. This host-gateway
route is required for model traffic and is not a port-level allowlist, so runner
firewall policy must protect other host services. When owners request network,
the co-hosted DSH process uses Docker bridge egress. This is not a destination
allowlist. Package acquisition also uses bridge networking even when the
package's later runtime mode is network-disabled.

## Controlled ToolRuntime limits and receipts

In controlled mode, the positive DSH policy assigns each native, MCP, or plugin
runtime tool:

- a per-call `timeoutMs`;
- a serialized `maxOutputBytes` limit;
- a per-tool `maxCalls` limit; and
- a group limit shared by the native workspace group or owning MCP/package.

Invocation counts are Controller-created state stored outside the disposable
DSH process, so fresh turns in one multi-turn loop cannot reset them. Counts are
reserved before dispatch. Crashes and failures therefore still consume an
invocation during normal routed execution. The state file is telemetry, not a
tamper-proof enforcement ledger against trusted code: an already-approved
extension shares the worker process/filesystem and can influence it.

MCP subprocess/HTTP timeout behavior is provided by the official client and the
Action abort signal. A same-process plugin timeout is cooperative: the policy
returns a controlled timeout result, while only the overall Controller deadline
can hard-stop a plugin that ignores cancellation by terminating the worker.

DSH durably records two-phase admission (`started`) and completion (`completed`)
events without arguments or tool output. The Controller reconciles those events
with the persistent tool and owner counters into one final receipt per call; a
worker crash after admission becomes `completed:false`. It aggregates those
final receipts across every fresh DSH turn before Action finalization. Receipt
collection reads only the newly appended byte range after the previous offset
and uses set membership when reconciling receipt order. This keeps repeated
multi-turn collection proportional to new records instead of rescanning the
whole file, without changing the receipt schema or security meaning.
`result-json.loop` separates Controller `toolReceipts` from DSH
`dshToolReceipts`; the bounded `tool-receipts` scalar output always serializes
`{"controller": [...], "dsh": [...], "truncated": false, "droppedCount": 0}`.
When the shared Action-output budget drops receipts, `truncated` becomes `true`
and `droppedCount` reports the exact number omitted; the retained arrays are
also used in `result-json.loop`, which records the same truncation count.
Receipts and extension audit data are observability only and never authorization
input or independent proof. Approved trusted extension code can influence
worker-side state and receipts.

Native mode does not manufacture equivalent Action policy rules or receipts for
DSH's full internal inventory. Its `observedTools` catalog is telemetry only.
The overall Action deadline, bounded turn count, process termination,
cancellation, cleanup, output bounds, and redaction still wrap every native DSH
turn independently of tool-level telemetry.

Controller GitHub receipts never contain credentials, raw request bodies, or
arbitrary URLs. Mutation receipts begin as scheduled telemetry, then finalization
reconciles them with bounded API attempts and postconditions. A malformed final
result, validation failure, or cancellation before flush drops the pending
queue. The bound repository and entity are revalidated immediately before each
externally visible mutation.

## Repository-mutation validation

Every code, Git ref and pull-request mutation requires `run-tests=true`, at
least one configured `test-commands` argv array, and successful completion of
every Controller validation command. `run-tests=false` denies the mutation and
is not a waiver. This hardening is intentionally stricter than the earlier
compatibility path; no model output, ToolRuntime receipt, or extension result
can replace the final validation gate.

v0.5.1 builds the validation-integrity audit from a normalized command graph,
including package-script entrypoints and Node wrapper options such as preload
modules. Strict mode treats replacement/removal of bound toolchain manifests or
locks, removed validation keys hidden by unrelated additions, and equivalent
wrapper indirection as control-plane changes. The graph and replay planning are
separate from execution, and a detected weakening still prevents every GitHub
mutation.

Controller-owned read-only lifecycle/status comments are publication telemetry
and may follow authorization before repository validation. A write request does
not call any comment API before every final Controller validation command
succeeds. A failed gate therefore produces no GitHub comment, commit, ref update
or pull request; its bounded failure remains in Action outputs and the step
summary.

The optional task-result schema is a finite root-object subset with byte,
depth, node, property, array, and string limits. `$ref`, combinators,
conditionals, regex patterns, unknown keywords, and prototype-sensitive keys
are rejected. DSH output is validated at the process boundary and again by the
outer Agent loop. The fixed `result-json` schema-v1 audit envelope remains the
Controller record; `taskOutput` is data only.

GitHub attachment images remain deferred. The exact audited
`@deepseek-ai/dsh-headless@0.2.1-rc.2` configuration accepts one `task` string
and constructs one text block, with no supported multimodal input contract.
The Action therefore removes Markdown image references from untrusted text and
does not download, mount, or forward attachment bytes through an unofficial
runtime path.

## Agent execution and Controller Sessions

`AgentEngine<TOutput, TMetadata>` remains the provider-neutral outer-turn
boundary. `DshAgentEngine` is the only current implementation. It receives the
Controller-selected operation, requested access, trusted instructions, bounded
untrusted context, effective manifests, bound workspace, and remaining timeout.
The Controller validates the returned protocol, operation, paths, and terminal
state before any validation, publication, or GitHub write.

`DshAgentEngine` lives with DSH execution and composition. Its turn contract
contains only the current task, capabilities, workspace, deadline, and result;
there are no reserved Session handles or pluggable stores. The Controller
Session implementation owns archive binding, preparation, restore, and save.

The redacted extension audit digest is included in public task identity and
output audit data, while the Controller-only complete configuration digest binds
runtime reuse. Neither digest is a reusable session credential.
